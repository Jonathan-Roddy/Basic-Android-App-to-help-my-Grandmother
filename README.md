# Basic-Android-App-to-help-my-Grandmother
This application was developed so that my grandmother had no issues loading a live stream of our local church services. 

She could not go to the URL and when she did she could not enable full screen. 
The Website in question did not allow me to grab live stream video Id so I was not able to create a basic homescreen shortcut that would open straight into the live stream.

This application creates a basic Webview given the url for the church service, calls on 2 javascripts scripts that will force play and then force fullscreen on load.

Simple and effective.
